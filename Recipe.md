1. Take whole wheat flour/atta in a bowl. Seive the whole wheat flour with salt. Add a bit of water and ghee and start mixing.
2. Adding some water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough.
3. Continue to knead the dough. keep on adding water as required. If you add all the water at once then the flour will become too sticky to handle. Also you need to knock down the dough with your fist while kneading. Gluten strands have to be formed. If gluten strands are not formed then it will be difficult to roll the rotis.

At the final stage of kneading the dough, some people also prefer to throw the dough from approx 1-2 feet height to the bowl while kneading. This helps in making the dough soft. But I prefer to apply pressure from my fist. In the pic below you can see the hand posture which is used to knead the dough.
4. Keep on kneading till the dough becomes pliable and soft. the final dough consistency should not be very soft or hard. The dough for rotis is more soft than the dough kneaded for Poori. after kneading the dough, it is advisable to cover it with a plate or cloth and keep it aside for 20 to 30 minutes. Although you can make the rotis straight away after kneading the dough but this 30 minute waiting period helps.

You can also use kitchenaid or roti maker appliances to knead the dough. I also use kitchenaid stand mixer to make the dough and it works really well. Many roti maker gadgets knead the dough well but till now there is not a good gadget which helps in puffing the rotis.
5. Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands.
6. Flatten the ball. Sprinkle some whole wheat flour to the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour.
7. Turn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot. The tawa has to be sufficiently hot to make soft rotis. I generally make rotis on a high flame. On sim or low flame, the rotis become hard and on a very high flame they cook too fast. So regulate the temperature while making the rotis.
8. While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle.
9. Keep on rolling till you get a circle as shown in the below pic. Making the round rotis is not easy and with practice you will be able to roll them round. Sprinkle some wheat flour if the dough begins to stretch or become sticky while rolling.
10. Now put the roti on a hot tawa/griddle.
